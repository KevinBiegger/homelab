# Kevin's Homelab
This project utilizes [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) and [GitOps](https://opengitops.dev/) to manage the provisioning, operations, and services of my homelab.

> ** What is a homelab? **
>
> A Homelab is a laboratoy at home where you can self-host, experiment with new technologies, practice for certifications, and so on.
> For more information, please see the [r/homelab introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/wiki/introduction) and the

## Overview
My homelab, as many are, is constantly in flux. I do not make any claims about the stability of this environment. That being said, I do my best to adhere to best-practices and ensure that the `main` branch is a working deployment.
